# Active Data

The goal of this library is to provide facilities for systematic data
modelling in the style of design recipes.

In particular, it includes

- *records* for representing compound data associated with a fixed
  "schema", addressing the shortcomings of Clojure
  records
- [*realms*](doc/realms.md) for describing data, enabling documentation, validation,
  and generating, addressing the shortcomings of `clojure.spec`,
  Schema, Malli and similar libraries.

[Here](doc/intro.md) is an introduction to Active Data.
